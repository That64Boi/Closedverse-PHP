# Closedverse-PHP
Closedverse PHP is a clone by Luke64 that's basically what it sounds like.
This was made to be a better alternative to the original CV code which
was written in python, overly complicated, probably has files missing,
and not very beginner, or any user of the code in general, friendly. This
Closedverse has awesome new features like advanced theme options, more
community types, etc.
